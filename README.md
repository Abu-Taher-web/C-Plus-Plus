This repository is part of my master's course named C++. Each folder contains an interesting problem and solutions. Donwnload, Run, Enjoy.

## 📥**Building and Running the Project**  

### 🐧**Linux Systems**  
If you're on a **Linux** system, you're all set! Simply:  
1. Navigate to the project directory.  
2. Run:  
   ```bash
   make
   ```  
3. Execute the compiled binary:  
   ```bash
   ./file_name.exe
   ```  

### 🪟**Windows Systems (Using WSL)**  
For **Windows** users, we recommend using **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** for the best compatibility.  

#### **1. Install WSL**  
Run the following command in **PowerShell (Admin)**:  
```powershell
wsl --install
```  
This will install **Ubuntu** by default.  

#### **2. Open WSL & Navigate to the Project**  
- After installation, open **Ubuntu** from the Start Menu.  
- Navigate to your project directory (use `/mnt/c/` to access Windows drives).  

#### **3. Compile & Run**  
```bash
make
./file_name.exe
```  

---

### **Why WSL?**  
- Provides a **native Linux environment** on Windows.  
- Ensures compatibility with standard **C++ toolchains** (`g++`, `make`).  
- Avoids Windows-specific build issues.  

## 🎯 Applications
- **🔧 Embedded Systems**
- **🏭 Industrial Automation**
- **🛡️ Augmented Reality (AR) and Defense**
